This is my final project for the Introduction to Computer Science class at Washington University in St Louis. 

The minimum requirements were to have a token constantly move up the screen, with obstacles to avoid and gems to collect. For my own enjoyment and challenge, I implemented the following designs:
- A procedurally-generated map system, which will add new obstacles after set rounds,
- A navigatable menu that includes an instruction screen and music playback options,
- The ability to change the music after the program starts,
- A life system that depletes as the token hits obstacles,
- Power-ups that slow the token down, restore life, and generate a shield to block an obstacle.
